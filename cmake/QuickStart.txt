FAQ
---
Q. How to I move the build libraries/exe to the root libtod directory?
A. There is an "install" target built into the makefile/project. Building it via
   "make install" or building it will do the copy.

Q. When do I have to run the generate script?
A. Whenever you modify CMakeLists.txt or delete the generated build files. 

Q. I get a nasty warning about the CMakeCache directory being different.
A. You most likely carried a release/debug directory over from one platform to another. 
   Go deleate cmake/release and cmake/debug and try again.

Q. Why doesn't msvc use upx to compress the exe's?
A. See this bug in cmake: http://www.itk.org/Bug/view.php?id=6242
